Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.


Optionals Completed
Optional: The full screen photo should be zoomable.
(implemented and works, but is buggy when combined with horizontal scrolling)
